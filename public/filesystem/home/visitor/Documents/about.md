# Jonathan Hu

## CU Boulder Bachelors in Applied Computer Science • NYU Bachelors in Applied Psychology

I'm a Software Engineer at Matrices, focused on building reliable and performant web applications. I work across the stack with TypeScript and React (Next.js), PostgreSQL, and modern tooling, with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, C, and C++."

I'm also passionate about data analytics and data science. Deriving insights from complex datasets, creating clear visualizations, and applying machine learning where it adds value. I enjoy solving complex problems end-to-end—from data modeling and APIs to front-end UX—while keeping solutions maintainable and user-focused. My background in Applied Computer Science and Psychology helps me bridge analytics and product engineering to deliver practical, thoughtful software.
